A collection of programs I wrote to solve problems in the Deital C How to Program 7th Edition book
All work was done by myself, Courtney Holsinger, without the aide of online study guides or solutions books.
The intended use of these programs is to display my own work, and not the be used as a free solution manual.  
I do not give my permission for these programs to be used in any way other than to serve as an example of my own work.
These programs were written using the XCode IDE.
In so far as I can, I have checked that all these programs function in accordance the with question in the book. 
I do not make any claims that running these programs are safe or that they will work for any purpose other than 
for their intended purpose.  
If you'd like to leave feedback or comments, I'd love to hear it, as I'm always trying to learn.  Please keept it contructive, however.  
At this time, I'm not looking for any further contributors.  If you would like to contribute, I recommend https://github.com/lbraglia/chtp as I plan to eventually contrubute to that project as well.
